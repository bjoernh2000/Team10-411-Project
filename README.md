## 1. Music Sharing Platform

Spotify Music sharing space, being able to log in through 3rd party Spotify. Every person on this platform will have some playlist that represents them on their profile, and the app would be able to suggest songs and other users with similar preferences to them. People can also create conversations (like tweets with a song/playlist/artist attached) to communicate with other users about interests. One API we will use is the Spotify API https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/ to get information about a person's genre/artist preferences to curate appropriate user playlists, and we will use the last.fm API https://www.last.fm/api to gather data about popular artists as it applies to people in general. The two APIs will work together inorder to understand general trends in music taste, as well as personal (single user) preferences.

## 2. Pinpoint Music Venues

This app idea would incorporate using some web scraper/api to get data for Music Venues around your geographical area in a selected time period. The Music Venues can be categorized with price, genre, artists, etc. This should allow users to be able to find more less-known artists, at a lower price-point. Can also suggest venues and artists based on past preferences. We will also use the Spotify API to get data on a user's genre and artist preferences, and the SongKick API https://www.songkick.com/developer to gather data on concert venues, prices, etc. These will work together to suggest concerts a user will potentially enjoy.
