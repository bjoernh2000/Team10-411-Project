## 1. Pinpoint Music Venues

This app idea would incorporate using some web scraper/api to get data for Music Venues around your geographical area and time period. The Music Venues can be categorized with price, genre, artists, etc. This should allow users to be able to find more less-known artists. Can also suggest venues based on past preferences. 

## 2. Music Sharing Platform

Spotify Music sharing space, being able to log in through 3rd party Spotify. Every person on this platform will have some playlist that represents them on their profile, and the app would be able to suggest songs and other users with similar preferences to them. People can also create conversations (like tweets with a song/playlist/artist attached) to communicate with other users about interests. Potential API: https://www.last.fm/api
