# Visiting profiles

When you want to visit someone else's profile, you will select the profile tab,
where you'll see your profile. You'll see a list of your friends, and if you
click on the their name, you'll be taken to their profile page. At the top of
your friends list, you'll also see a search bar where you can search for anyone
who uses the application, whether they're your friend or not.

When visiting another user's profile, you'll be able to listen to the chosen
15-second clip of a specific song that user has chosen as an overview to
represent themselves with. You have the option to have the music start as
soon as you open up a user's profile or you can manually press a play button
that plays the song. Also, you'll be able to see that person's playlist and
their friend list. You can also see, in real time, what that person
is listening to.
