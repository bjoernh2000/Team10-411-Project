# Login

You will open the app and be prompted to either log in, or create a new account.
If you choose to log in, you'll log in through your Spotify account by clicking
on a button that will lead you to fill in your spotify account username and
password. If you do not have a Spotify account, you will be kindly requested to
create a new Spotify account and link it to log into our application. If you
choose to create a new account, refer to the secondary story **Setting Up
Profile**. Once you're logged in, you'll see your discovery page.
