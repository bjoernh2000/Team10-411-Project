# Adding and Removing Friends

If you want to connect with your friends, you can go t your profile and search
for other users. You can search by people's display name or their Spotify
username. After you find the person you're looking for, you can send them a
friend request, which they can either accept or reject.

If you want to remove one of your current friends, you can go through your
friends list, find the friend you want to remove, and go to their profile. On
their profile page, you'll be able to click the "remove friend" button. You
will see a pop-up asking you to confirm that you want to remove that friend.
