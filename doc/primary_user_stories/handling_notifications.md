# Handling Notifications

When you receive a notification, you'll see a popup on your screen. You click on
the notification in order to read it and handle it appropriately. When you're on
the page, you'll see a list of notifications on the left side of the page, and
if you click on a notification, you'll see the full message on the right. Unread
notifications will have a red dot next to the message which will then disappear
to mark it as read. You can choose to delete the notification by clicking the
trash icon next to it in the notifications list, and it will be removed from the
list. You can click on the "return to previous page" button and will be brought
back to the page you were previously on.
