# Share Music

If you want to share a song with your friend, select the "share music" tab from
the navigation bar at the top of the page. You'll see a search bar beneath the
share music tab, and you can click on it to search Spotify for the song you want
to share. Once you select a song, a draft of a post will pop up with a text
field for you to add a caption, and you'll select who you want to share the song
with. You'll be prompted to choose to share the song publicly or privately; if
you choose to share publicly, all of your friends will be able to see who you
shared it with on their discovery page. If you choose to share privately, it
will only be seen by those you shared the song with. You can select up to 10
people to share the song with at once.
