# Setting Up Profile

When registering with a Spotify account, you'll be prompted to sign into that
account. If your credentials are valid, you'll be redirected to the profile
personalization page. If the credentials are invalid, you'll be prompted to try
again. (Potentially, a preset number of incorrect logins will cause the
application to lock you out for a certain length of time).

On the profile personalization page, you'll be required to add a display name,
ideally your first name. You may add your last name if you wish. You will
optionally be able to add a profile picture and a short "about me" blurb. When
you're done filling out your profile, you'll be directed to create your
playlist. The app will create a playlist for you based on what you listen to the
most. If you are not satisfied with the playlist, you can either manually change
the songs or generate an entirely new playlist. Finally, save your profile.
