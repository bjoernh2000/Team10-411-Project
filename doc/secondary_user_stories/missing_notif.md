# Missing a Notification Popup

As a user, you will receive notifications, indicated by popups on the screen
that show a brief description of the notification text. The notification
fades before you have time to click on it, but you still want to handle the
notification. The icon in the navigation bar for the notification
page has a number on the corner showing how many notifications you have. You
click on the notification page icon in the navigation bar and are taken to the
notifications page. (See **Handling Notifications**)
