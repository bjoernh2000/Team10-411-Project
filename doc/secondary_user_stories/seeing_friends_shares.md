# Seeing Music Others Have Shared

If you want to see music your friends have shared with others, head to the
discovery page. On that page, you'll see posts of the mustic that your friends
recommended to other people. You'll see who your friends sent it to and the name
of the song that was shared. You can like and comment on the past. If you click
the post, you'll see a threaded view of all the comments.
