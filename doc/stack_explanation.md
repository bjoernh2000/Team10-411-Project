# Technology Choice

As a team, we decided to use Python's Flask framework for the backend, and vanilla javascript and HTML for the frontend in our application. 

We chose the Python Flask framework as a lot of our team members were already somewhat familiar with it, and it is much simpler to pick up than node.js since python is very easy to pick up and allows developers to get started very quickly. Compared to Django, Flask is also minimalistic and better from the ground up, as we get to design every aspect of data management (such as users) and full control of the implementation whereas Django manages some of these automatically.

The Frontend was chosen to be plain javascript without major frameworks such as Vue or libraries such as React. This was to allow us getting started quicker. Plain javascript has less requirements and is much more flexible to allow us to structure the application in any way we see fit, whereas React is much more rigid and many different aspects to it. If the app gets more complicated, a framework can be adapted to be ported, but for a simple prototype plain javascript is sufficient.
